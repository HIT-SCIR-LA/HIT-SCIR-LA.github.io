 abstract = {We address the problem of Chinese semantic dependency parsing. Dependency parsing is traditionally oriented to syntax analysis, which we denote by syntactic dependency parsing to distinguish it from semantic dependency parsing. In this paper, firstly we compare Chinese semantic dependency parsing and syntactic dependency parsing systematically, showing that syntactic dependency parsing can potentially improve the performance of semantic dependency parsing. Thus then we suggest an approach based on quasi},
