 abstract = {Word segmentation problem is widely solved as the sequence labeling problem. The traditional way to this kind of problem is machine learning method like conditional random field with hand-crafted features. Recently, deep learning approaches have achieved state-of-the-art performance on word segmentation task and a popular method of them is LSTM networks. This paper gives a method to introduce numerical statistics-based features counted on unlabeled data into LSTM networks and analyzes how it enhances the},
