 abstract = {Spoken language understanding (SLU) systems aim to understand users' utterance, which is a key component of task-oriented dialogue systems. In this paper, we focus on improving the contextual SLU. The contextual SLU systems mainly focus on how to effectively incorporate dialog context information (contextual information). The existing approaches all use the same contextual information to guide slot filling at all tokens, which may inject the irrelevant information and result in ambiguity. To tackle this problem, we propose a context},
