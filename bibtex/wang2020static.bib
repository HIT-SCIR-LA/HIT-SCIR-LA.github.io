 abstract = {In the history of natural language processing (NLP) development, the representation of words has always been a significant research topic. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive typology of word representation models from a novel perspective that the development from static to dynamic embeddings can effectively address the polysemy problem, which has been a great challenge in this field. Then the survey covers the main evaluation metrics and applications of these word embeddings. And, we further discuss the},
