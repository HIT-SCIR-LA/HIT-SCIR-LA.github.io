 abstract = {Achieving human-level performance on some Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) datasets is no longer challenging with the help of powerful Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). However, it is necessary to provide both answer prediction and its explanation to further improve the MRC system's reliability, especially for real-life applications. In this paper, we propose a new benchmark called ExpMRC for evaluating the textual explainability of the MRC systems. ExpMRC contains four subsets, including SQuAD, CMRC},
