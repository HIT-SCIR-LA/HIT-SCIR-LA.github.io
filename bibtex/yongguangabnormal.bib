 abstract = {This paper discusses the clustering technology about the abnormal short texts and proposes an efficient clustering algorithm based on the duplication information deletion algorithm. It concerns about the features of the abnormal short texts and takes some special methods such as extracting feature code and compressing code to solve this problem. Experiments show that the clustering system based on this algorithm can depose lots of abnormal short texts with high accuracy and high speed.},
