 abstract = {Previous neural models on open-domain conversation generation have no effective mechanisms to manage chatting topics, and tend to produce less coherent dialogs. Inspired by the strategies in human-human dialogs, we divide the task of multi-turn open-domain conversation generation into two sub-tasks: explicit goal (chatting about a topic) sequence planning and goal completion by topic elaboration. To this end, we propose a three-layer Knowledge aware Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning based Model (KnowHRL)},
