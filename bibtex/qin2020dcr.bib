 abstract = {In dialog system, dialog act recognition and sentiment classification are two correlative tasks to capture speakers' intentions, where dialog act and sentiment can indicate the explicit and the implicit intentions separately (Kim and Kim 2018). Most of the existing systems either treat them as separate tasks or just jointly model the two tasks by sharing parameters in an implicit way without explicitly modeling mutual interaction and relation. To address this problem, we propose a Deep Co-Interactive Relation Network (DCR-Net) to explicitly},
