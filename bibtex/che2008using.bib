 abstract = {As a kind of Shallow Semantic Parsing, Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is gaining more attention as it benefits a wide range of natural language processing applications. Given a sentence, the task of SRL is to recognize semantic arguments (roles) for each predicate (target verb or noun). Feature-based methods have achieved much success in SRL and are regarded as the state-of-the-art methods for SRL. However, these methods are less effective in modeling structured features. As an extension of feature-based methods, kernel-based},
