 abstract = {Semantic role labeling is a feasible proposal to shallow semantic parsing. A maximum entropy classifier is used in the semantic role labeling system, which takes syntactic constituents as the labeled units. The maximum entropy classifier is trained to identify and classify the predicates' semantic roles at the same time. Some useful features and their combinations are used in the classifier. In the post-processing step, only the roles with the highest probability among the embedding ones are kept. After predicting all the arguments},
