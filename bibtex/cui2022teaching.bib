 abstract = {With various Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) blooming, Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) systems have embraced significant improvements on various benchmarks and even surpassed human performances. However, most existing works only focus on the accuracy of the answer predictions and neglect the importance of the explanations for the prediction, which is a big obstacle when utilizing these models in real-life applications to convince humans. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised self},
