 abstract = {Semantic Dependency Parsing (SDP) is a deep semantic analysis task. A well-formed dependency scheme is the foundation of SDP. In this paper, we refine the HIT dependency scheme using stronger linguistic theories, yielding a dependency scheme with more clear hierarchy. To cover Chinese semantics more comprehensively, we make a break away from the constraints of dependency trees, and extend to graphs. Moreover, we utilize SVM to parse semantic dependency graphs on the basis of parsing of dependency trees.},
