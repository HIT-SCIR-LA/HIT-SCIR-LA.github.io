 abstract = {Deep Neural Network has been applied to many Natural Language Processing tasks. Instead of building hand-craft features, DNN builds features by automatic learning, fitting different domains well. In this paper, we propose a novel convolution network, incorporating lexical features, applied to Relation Extraction. Since many current deep neural networks use word embedding by word table, which, however, neglects semantic meaning among words, we import a new coding method, which coding input words by},
