 abstract = {Previous Seq2Seq models for chitchat assume that each word in the target sequence has direct corresponding relationship with words in the source sequence, and all the target words are equally important. However, it is invalid since sometimes only parts of the response are relevant to the message. For models with the above mentioned assumption, irrelevant response words might have a negative impact on the performance in semantic association modeling that is a core task for open-domain dialogue modeling.
