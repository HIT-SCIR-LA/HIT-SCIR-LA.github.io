 abstract = {Dependency parsing has gained more and more interest in natural language processing in recent years due to its simplicity and general applicability for diverse languages. Previous work demonstrates that part-of-speech (POS) is an indispensable feature in dependency parsing since pure lexical features suffer from serious data sparseness problem. However, due to little morphological changes, Chinese POS tagging has proven to be much more challenging than morphology-richer languages such as English (94% vs. 97% on POS},
