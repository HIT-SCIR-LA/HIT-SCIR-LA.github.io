 abstract = {In semi-supervised learning framework, clustering has been proved a helpful feature to improve system performance in NER and other NLP tasks. However, there hasn't been any work that employs clustering in word segmentation. In this paper, we proposed a new approach to compute clusters of characters and use these results to assist a character based Chinese word segmentation system. Contextual information is considered when we perform character clustering algorithm to address character ambiguity. Experiments show our},
