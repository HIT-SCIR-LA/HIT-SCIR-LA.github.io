 abstract = {Many problems in natural language processing (NLP) can be cast as the problem of segmenting a sequence. In this article, we combine the semi-Markov conditional random fields (semi-CRF) with neural networks to solve NLP segmentation problems. We focus on the segment representation in neural semi-CRF which is important to the performance. Based on our preliminary work in Liu et al.[1], we represent a segment by both encoding the subsequence and embedding the segment string. We conduct a systematic study of the},
