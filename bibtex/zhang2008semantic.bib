 abstract = {Convolution tree kernel has shown promising results in semantic role labeling (SRL). However, this kernel does not consider much linguistic knowledge in kernel design and only performs hard matching between subtrees. To overcome these constraints, this paper proposes a grammar-driven convolution tree kernel for SRL by introducing more linguistic knowledge. Compared with the standard convolution tree kernel, the proposed grammar-driven kernel has two advantages: 1) grammar-driven approximate substructure matching},
