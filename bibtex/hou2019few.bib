 abstract = {While few-shot classification has been widely explored with similarity based methods, few-shot sequence labeling poses a unique challenge as it also calls for modeling the label dependencies. To consider both the item similarity and label dependency, we propose to leverage the conditional random fields (CRFs) in few-shot sequence labeling. It calculates emission score with similarity based methods and obtains transition score with a specially designed transfer mechanism. When applying CRF in the few-shot scenarios, the},
