 abstract = {In this paper, we apply a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with a Conditional Random Field to the task of disfluency detection. Long-range dependencies is one of the core problems for disfluency detection. Our model handles long-range dependencies by both using the Long Short-Term Memory and hand-crafted discrete features. Experiments show that utilizing the hand-crafted discrete features significantly improves the model's performance by achieving the state-of-the-art score of 87.1% on the Switchboard corpus.},
