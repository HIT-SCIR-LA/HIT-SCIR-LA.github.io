 abstract = {The paper describes our system of Shared Task on Parsing the Web. We only participate in dependency parsing task. A number of methods have been developed for dependency parsing. Each of the methods adopts very different view of dependency parsing, and each view can have its strengths and limitations. Thus system combination can have great potential to further improve the performance of dependency parsing. In this work, Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging) is chosen to combine these methods. This approach obtains},
