 abstract = {Chinese grammar engineering has been a much debated task. Whilst semantic information has been reconed crucial for Chinese syntactic analysis and downstream applications, existing Chinese treebanks lack a consistent and strict sentential semantic formalism. In this paper, we introduce a semantics oriented grammar for Chinese, designed to provide basic supports for tasks such as automatic semantic parsing and sentence generation. It has a directed acyclic graph structure with a simple yet expressive label set, and leverages},
